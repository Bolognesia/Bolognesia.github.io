										<p class="paragraph">There are 3 things that for sure I love: My dog, dancing and designing.</p>

										<p class="paragraph">I’m a Latina, and we love a good backstory, but I promise I’ll do my best to keep it short and sweet (I'll try!!). Back in Chile, I studied to be a Sociologist and work in different NGO or government agencies. This made me realise how much I love research, analysis and working in a team environment with a focus on creating a positive impact in society. I had the chance to work with politicians and stakeholders to secure investments and create different methodological tools to be used in gender equality workshops. These were implemented in over 10 schools around Santiago.  </p>

										<p class="paragraph">I packed 2 big suitcases of winter clothes and moved here in 2011. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work in diverse environments such as Quality Control and Microbiology. I won’t go into detail about every job I've done in New Zealand, because… honestly: it’s too much! But I can tell you that I have gained valuable experience training people, following procedures, learning 2 extra languages, adjusting to deadlines, and basically just working, working, working…  and doing competitive dancing! (A way to keep myself closer to my South American roots). </p>

										<p class="paragraph">I always missed conducting research and being creative, as I used to in my work as a Sociologist. In 2021, I decided to change my career pathway and give study another chance. I studied to become a Website Developer and UX Designer, “just to see if I liked it”. Little did I know, I was going to fall in love with designing and coding. I was able to piece together the creativeness of design, the methodology of research and the logical structure of coding. A perfect balance!</p>

								<h2 class="right-align">Ready to dive in!</h2>

									</div>
									<div class="paragraph-wrapper">

										<p class="paragraph">Since then, I have been dedicating myself to study, working on personal projects, learning new tools while working part time and paying my mortgage (not easy!). During the past 2 years I learnt from scratch how to work through frameworks like Vue.js, build CMS interfaces with SilverStripe using AWS and PHP and have become efficient at designing and running user researches through different techniques -A/B comparison, iterations, surveys, etc- to determine whether a web design is appropriate for a specific brand. I've learnt to be proficient at using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and even Adobe Illustrator, but I’m sure you already checked my CV haha.</p>

										<p class="paragraph">I’m passionate about working with people, and I hope to provide my skills and assets to a company that delivers the best results for their clients. I’m adaptable and capable of transferring my skills to learn new coding languages and methodologies (psss... I still need to pay my mortgage).</p>
