										<p class="paragraph">I’m Latina, and we love a good history, but I promise you that I’ll do my best to keep it short and sweet.Back in Chile, I studied to be a Sociologist and work in different NGO or government agencies. Luckily, I found an amazing job coordinating a part of a project to create awareness about violence in early relationships and talk about gender equality, which honestly, showed me how much I love to do research, analysis, and work in a team environment with a big commitment about create a positive impact in society. I had the chance to work with politicians and stakeholders to secure more investment and create different methodological tools to be use in gender equality workshops implemented in over 10 schools around Santiago. </p>

										<p class="paragraph">I packed 2 big suitcases of winter clothes and I moved to here in 2011. Since then, I had the chance to work in diverse environments such as Quality Control and Microbiology. I won’t go in detail of every single job I did in New Zealand, because… Honestly: Is too much! But I can tell you that I gained valuable experience training people, following procedures, learning 2 extra languages, adjusting to deadlines, and basically just working, working, working…  and doing competitive dancing! (A way to keep myself closer to my South American roots) </p>

										<p class="paragraph">I always miss to do research and be creative as I used to be working as a Sociologist. In 2021, I decided to change my career pathway and give a chance to study to become a Website Developer and UX Designer, “just to check if I like it”. Little I knew that I was going to fall in love of designing and coding. I was able to put together the creativeness of the designing, the methodology of research and the logical structure of coding. A perfect balance!</p>

									<div class="paragraph-wrapper">

										<p class="paragraph">Since then, I have been dedicating myself to study very hard, work in small personal projects and keep myself open to learn new tools, while working part time and paying my mortgage (no easy!) During the past 2 years I learned from zero, to basically be able to work through frameworks like Vue.js, build CMS interfaces with SilverStripe using AWS and PHP, become fast at designing and run user research to determine whether a web design is appropriate or not for a specific brand, be proficient using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and even Adobe Illustrator. But I’m sure you already checked my CV hahaha.  </p>

										<p class="paragraph">I’m passionate to work with people and to bring up my best skills and assets to a company that want to deliver their best to clients. I’m adaptable and capable of transfer my skills to learn new coding languages and methodologies.</p>
